					<p class="marcellus-regular">The goal in question is about protecting the world’s cultural and natural heritage — things like historic buildings, monuments, archaeological sites, natural parks, and landscapes. To measure progress, there is an indicator that tracks how much money, on average per person (“per-capita”), countries spend on preserving and protecting this heritage. The money can come from governments or private sources, and can be spent at national, regional, or local levels.</p>
					<p class="marcellus-regular">In recent years, many more countries have begun reporting these heritage-spending figures — 82 countries now, which is three times as many as five years ago. That shows a growing global commitment to keeping track of how we care for heritage sites. This includes many developing countries now reporting data; previously most reports came only from wealthy regions.</p>
					<p class="marcellus-regular">Most countries currently report only their government spending. Between 2019 and 2023, the typical amount governments spent per person on heritage protection was about 18-19 euro. But the amounts vary a lot between countries. Wealthier regions like Europe and North America spend much more—about 71.84 euro per person—while developing countries spend far less, around 3.46 euro per person.</p>
					<p class="marcellus-regular">So, while some countries invest a fair amount per person to protect heritage, many invest very little — highlighting big global differences in resources and priorities.</p>

					<p class="marcellus-regular">When we look at how this has changed over time (from 2017 to 2023), most countries increased their spending per person. In a few countries, the increase was dramatic (over 100 %), meaning their heritage protection budgets rose sharply. In other cases, funding decreased — but usually not by more than about 40–50%.</p>
					<p class="marcellus-regular">However — a warning: sometimes the increase does not reflect a big new spending program, but rather better measurement and reporting. Some countries, by improving how they collect data, suddenly report higher spending — even if actual money spent didn’t change much. This matters because good, comparable data is essential to see the real global picture of heritage protection.</p>
					<p class="marcellus-regular">Because of these complexities, an international agency (the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, or UIS) continues to help countries with better methods, support data collection, and work toward complete, consistent reporting. The goal is that eventually we’ll be able to compare and track heritage conservation efforts worldwide — and know whether we’re doing enough to protect the world’s history and natural treasures."</p>
