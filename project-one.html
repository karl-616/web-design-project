				<p class="marcellus-regular"> The UN Sustainable Development Goals target 11.1 is to ensure safe and affordable housing to all, as well as to upgrade slums and ensure access to basic services by 2030. Housing is crucial for human livelihood. Half the world's population lives in urban areas, underscoring the need to build safe, affordable housing for them. </p>
				
				<p class="marcellus-regular">Despite the clear need for sustainable housing, it cannot be developed without completely changing the way we build, plan, and manage our urban spaces. making clear policies that set clear, realistic targets based on a thorough assessment of housing need and target capacities, if existing housing resources exist, ensuring that development is both effective and sustainable</p>
				
				<p class="marcellus-regular">Expanding access to affordable housing can improve both physical and mental health, reduce homelessness, and enable more people and families to have access to secure and safe housing, which can also enhance financial security, as when people aren't overwhelmed with housing costs, they have more income to spend, which can stimulate the economy and boost economic growth..</p>

				<br>
				<img src="img/Tanz-KW.jpg" alt="img2"  id="KW-P1-img2">
				<p class="marcellus-regular"> There are 10 targets in goal 11, target 11.1 pushes the government to address the slum housing supply, basic services, and urban management that their people need.this applys greatly to a place like tanzania  given its rapid urbanization, which has experienced an estimated growth rate of 5.4% per annum, leading to a shortage of affordable and safe housing and basic services. This agenda outlines various targets to indicate how sustainable cities should look to overcome a shortage of safe, affordable housing.</p>
				
				<p class="marcellus-regular">SDG 11 encourages countries like Tanzania, through targets such as 11.1, to reform their housing systems by evaluating housing finance projects, such as the 2010 project focused on 1000 units by the national housing corporation, as well as the 815-unit housing projects by the Tanzania building agency. </p>
				
				<p class="marcellus-regular">There is a housing deficit of 3 million units in Tanzania, with an annual demand of about 200,000 units, yet supplies remain far below the need. This shortage directly shows the importance of expanding access to affordable housing.  </p>
				
				<p class="marcellus-regular">Although Tanzania is far behind on the housing it needs, it has started to address the problem by designing an information center with the purpose of collecting, storing, and analyzing housing data to predict housing demand and the resources needed to build it </p>
